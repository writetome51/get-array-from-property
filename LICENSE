/******************
 Amendment Note:
 I found one fatal flaw in Fredrik Forsmo's code:  he converted the passed
 property argument to lower-case, which makes this function useless with
 objects that have camel-cased properties.  I removed the lower-case
 conversion. I also switched the order of the arguments.
 So the code in this package is my forking of Fredrik Forsmo's code.
